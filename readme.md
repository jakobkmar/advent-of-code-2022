# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my Advent of Code solutions for the year 2022.

You can find [the code for all solutions here](/src/main/kotlin).

[**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for
twenty-five days.
